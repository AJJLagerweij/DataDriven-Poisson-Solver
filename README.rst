Frankenstein's method is an attempt to solve physics problems in a data-driven manner. The objective of the project is rely on measurable quantities only and to not make any assumptions on the locality of the problem. The method should work for local and for non-local problems. In this simplified implementation reversibility is assumed, as a result it can only handle elastic materials, this does include non-linear elasticity.
