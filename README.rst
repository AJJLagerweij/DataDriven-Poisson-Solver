Frankenstein's method is an attempt to solve physics problems in a data-driven manner. The objective of the project is rely on measurable quantities only and to not make any assumptions on the locality of the problem. As an intermediate problem we approach a known differential equation, the Poisson equation through Frankenstein's method. We understand particulars of this linear PDE and that it can be split in a homogeneous and particular part.

Frankenstein's method finds the particular part by matching the right hand side of the patch to that of the domain. The homogeneous solution is solved for generically by allowing the full freedom required to capture it. In a Poisson equation homogeneous solution is any linear equaton. Thus the primal in each domain is that of the patch + a linear pertubation.

The result is that this method will always find the exact solution to the PDE, if the database is rich enough to cover
all the required right hand sides required.
