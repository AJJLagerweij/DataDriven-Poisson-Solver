The configuration is a proposed solution for the problem.

A :py:class:`~configuration.Configuration` includes the selection of :py:class:`~patch.Patch` from
:py:class:`~patch.PatchDatabase` for each of the domains described by :py:class:`~problem.Problem`. It contains the not
yet fixed rigid body motion displacement variables and the coordinate transformation as free variables, the optimal
value of which will be found through an optimization process.

The :py:class:`~configuration.ConfigurationDatabase` contains a collection with all configurations that are considered.
It will also allow for the access to the optimization and other methods of the configurations in a parallel manner, as
the those are independent.

        The calculations first compute the contributions of the static boundary to the equilibrium equations, this can
        be evaluated exactly as the static state at the static boundary is exactly formulated in the problem definition.
        Then on the kinematic boundary the reaction forces and moments are extracted from the external forces that were
        applied to the patches chosen, which are then added to the global equilibrium calculations.

        .. note:: Technically the reaction forces are dependent of the coordinate translation of each domain which are
            unknown before the optimization is ran. But in this case we only have kinematic point constraints. And for
            each patch there are two options, the static fields are constants and hence the translations are free or
            the static fields are fluctuating (linear or with punctures) in which case the translation is fixed. Both
            result in the same, the equilibrium will not change with the optimization as it is either constant with
            translation or the translation itself is a constant. Hence the equilibrium equation can be evaluated before
            the optimization, this will greatly reduce the amount of configurations that have to be optimized for. This
            is NOT applicable to 2-dimensional problem.

        r"""
        Calculate alternative error norms for the configuration.

        An error represents how wel the domain decomposition satisfies the kinematic and static requirements.

        Purely Kinematic Norms
        ----------------------
        These norms only consider kinematic matching on the overlap areas. All these norms equal 0 for the exact
        solution. As these norms are also applicable to 2D/3D solids the :math:`\nabla` icon is used to indicate spacial
        derivatives. These are the easiest to quantify as it does not require any static information. After all, internal
        statics cannot be measured directly.

        The Euclidean norm :math:`L^2(u)` (also called the :math:`H^0(u)` norm) in the overlapping region.

        .. math:: L^2(u) = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} \| u_a - u_b \|^2 dx}

        The first Hilbert norm :math:`H^1(u)` in the overlapping regions.

        .. math:: H^1(u) = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} \| u_a - u_b \|^2
            + \| \nabla u_a - \nabla u_b\|^2 dx}

        The second Hilbert norm :math:`H^2(u)` in the overlapping regions.

        .. math:: H^2(u) = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} \| u_a - u_b \|^2
            + \| \nabla u_a - \nabla u_b\|^2 + \| \nabla^2 u_a - \nabla^2 u_b \|^2 dx}

        The third Hilbert norm :math:`H^3(u)` in the overlapping regions.

        .. math:: H^3(u) = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} \| u_a - u_b \|^2
            + \| \nabla u_a - \nabla u_b\|^2 + \| \nabla^2 u_a - \nabla^2 u_b \|^2
            + \| \nabla^3 u_a - \nabla^3 u_b \|^2 dx}

        Purely Static Norms
        -------------------
        The following norm only depends on the statics. Hence it cannot be used to find the rigid body motion
        components, as these will not affect statics.

        The Euclidean norm of the moment :math:`L^2(M)` in the overlapping region.

        .. math:: L^2(M) = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} \| M_a - M_b \|^2 dx}

        The Euclidean norm comparing the 'global internal moment' to the domain moments. This global internal moment
        is computed from the external reaction forces, which is only possible if all the external forces are in
        equilibrium with each other. For more details see :py:meth:`self.global_moment`.

        .. math:: L^2(M_d-M^\text{global}) = \sum_{d=1}^{D} \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_d} \| M_d - M^\text{global} \|^2 dx}

        Norms combining patch statics and kinematics in the overlapping region
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        These norms require static information, and can thus be related to some energy. The required internal moments
        information is available for each patch, as the reaction forces/moments were measured during testing. This
        information cannot be obtained for 2D or 3D solids, and only applicable to beams, trusses and other 1D
        structures.

        A norm characterizing the strain in energy missmatch on the overlapping region. The three parts of this norm are
        returned separately, the first term as `E_Deltamddu`, the second term as `L2` and the last one as `ML2`.

        .. math:: \mathcal{E}_{\Delta M u''} = \sum_{a=1}^D \sum_{b>a}^D \frac{1}{2}
            \sqrt{\int_{\Omega_a\cap\Omega_b} M_a u''_a - M_b u''_b
            + \lambda_u (u_a - u_b)^2 + \lambda_M (M_a - M_b)^2 dx}
